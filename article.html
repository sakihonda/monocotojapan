                <p>As a kid growing up in suburban Pennsylvania in the ’90s, I lived for Silent Sustained Reading, or SSR, that point in the school day when the teacher asked us to clear our desks of everything but a book. This was typically also the point when kids tended to become a little rowdy, but I got smug satisfaction in staying out of whatever trouble was brewing. I loved being the nerd in the front row of the classroom, burning through chapters, wearing the glasses I had desperately wanted but didn’t really need.</p>
                <img src="images/top/coverphoto.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>Even after I grew up and left SSR behind, I continued to love that image of myself. But as I got further into adulthood, I realized just how much I didn’t understand about the books I had read as a kid. I spent my first five post-college years working in the children’s division of a major book publisher, and there’s nothing quite like discussing Dr. Seuss and The Giver in weekly sales meetings to change your perspective on what those stories really mean. So when I decided earlier this year that I wanted to start a podcast, I knew almost immediately what I wanted it to be: a look back at all those old favorites, this time through older, wiser eyes. (In an homage to my beloved SSR, it’s called The SSR Podcast, this time standing for Shit She Read.)</p>
                <p>Twenty episodes in, I’ve made my way through enough of my elementary- and middle-school staples to realize how much the experience of reading them has changed — really, how much I’ve changed. Reexamining the literature of my childhood has opened my eyes to how time, place, and context shape the way we absorb pop culture at any age. It’s also given me a road map of my own personal evolution, providing specific markers that allow me to look back at my coming-of-age experience and see where and how my adult self — my goals, my opinions, my likes and dislikes — began to take shape.</p>
                <p>I’ve grown out of a childish ambition to be righteous.I’ve been a perfectionist for as long as I can remember, which in my early years manifested itself in your predictable Goody Two-shoes tendencies. Given the choice between Jessica and Elizabeth Wakefield in Sweet Valley High, for example, I would have picked the straitlaced, conservative, bookish latter twin every time. On a recent trip back to Sweet Valley, though, I found Elizabeth grating, condescending, and a little dull. While I initially felt some guilt for abandoning my one-time idol in favor of her more free-spirited sister, I realized that somewhere along the way, I had grown out of the desire to be perfect that had so motivated my actions as a kid (and that my decision two years ago to quit my corporate job and pursue writing full time was proof of how far I had come).</p>
                <p>I’m still largely a play-by-the-rules kind of person, but I now see in each of the literary heroines I once tried to emulate a person who was trying painfully hard to do exactly what was expected of her, all the time — and it’s been refreshing to reflect on how I’ve been able to let this go. In coming back to childhood books, you may discover that you no longer connect with the characters you once idolized. It’s a little jarring, but take it as a sign of personal growth.</p>
